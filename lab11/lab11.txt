#CS 262 -- Lab11
##11/14/2020

I used VS Code, ESLint extension to edit the pickUp.js file in our client repo.

Changes:
-Changed double to single quotes
-Removed TouchableOpacity import package because we currently aren't using it
-Removed the last comma in the import {} because I don't need it unless I list another item after
-Left trialing semicolons because of personal preference
-Removed the navigation variable as the parameter in pickUp() because it is never used
